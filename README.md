Deep Learning with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) made easy ðŸš€ !

## v0.5.x WIP!

Here are the main design principles:
- The codes should be '`module` first', which means all previous `model`s should be a simple `module` now.
  - And `model` should only be related to the training stuffs. If we only want to use the fancy AI models at inference stage, `module` should be all we need.
- The `module`s should be as 'native' as possible: no inheritance from base classes except `nn.Module` should be the best, and previous inheritance-based features should be achieved by **dependency injection**.
  - This helps the `module`s to be more `torch.compile` friendly.
- Training stuffs are not considered at the first place, but they will definitely be added later on, based on the modern AI developments.
- APIs will be as BC as possible.
